This is a simple website allowing the user to calculate the component values for either a Passive Low Pass Filter or a Passive High Pass Filter.

The user enters 2 out of the 3 required values, and the calculator will calculate the value of the third component.

The goals of this website are:
* Generate traffic in order to generate AdSense revenue.

The user visit this website to:
* Calculate the component values for Passive Low Pass or Passive High Pass filters.
* An example of this would be to limit the lowest frequencies being sent to a pair of hi-fi speakers.

# UX
The design of the site is purposefully simple and single-use focussed. There are only two calculators at this stage, and the site makes it easy for the user to know which filter type they are calculating component values for.

### Ideal client 
The ideal client for this business is: 
* Electronic hobbyist
* Hi-Fi enthusiast
* Hi-Fi circuit designer
* Audiophile hobbyist

The project help clients to: 
* Determine the component values or cut-off frequency for a set of known components.

### User stories: 
1.	As a visitor, I am designing a Passive High Pass Filter to limit the minimum freqency signal being passed to the amplifier inputs of a hi-fi system. I know what the amplifier's input impedence is (300 mOhm), and know the desired cut-off frequency (50Hz). I can use the Passive High Pass Filter calculator to determine the Capacitance required (10.61pF) for the capacitor in the circuit, to achieve the desired cut-off frequency.
2.	As a visitor, I am designing a Passive Low Pass Filter to limit the maximum freqency signal being passed to the sub-woofer inputs of a hi-fi system. I know what the sub-woofer's input impedence is (300 mOhm), and know the desired cut-off frequency (50Hz). I can use the Passive Low Pass Filter calculator to determine the Capacitance required (10.61pF) for the capacitor in the circuit, to achieve the desired cut-off frequency.
3.	As a visitor, I am designing a Sub-woofer amplifier input circuit. I've completed the design and in testing want to calculate the actual cut-off frequency of the input-circuit. Baed on the Capacitance and Input Impedence in the design, I can use the Passive Low Pass Filter calculator to determine the actual cut-off frequency of the design.
4.	As a visitor, I am designing a Sub-woofer amplifier input circuit, with a Variable Resistor. I've completed the design and in testing want to calculate the actual reange of cut-off frequencies of the input-circuit. Baed on the Capacitance and Input Impedence, together with the range of the Variable Resistor in the design, I can use the Passive Low Pass Filter calculator to determine the actual cut-off frequency of the design.

### Scope
To help the visitor achieve their circuit design goals, I included the following features in the website: 
* Passive Low Pass Filter calculator.
* Passive High Pass FIlter calculator.
* Calculation Formula and Legend, showing the formula used in the calculations.
* Simple High Pass and Low Pass Filter diagrams.
* Basic High Pass and Low Pass Circuit Layout DIagrams, showing the difference in required circuit layout for each filter type.
* Diagrams showing the different -3dB cut-off frequency graphs for the Low Pass and High Pass filters respectively.

## Skeleton 
The website consists of only 3 pages. An initial landing page, with the options between the two calculator pages. A page for Passive High Pass FIlter and a third for the Passive Low Pass FIlter.

# Features 

# Existing Features 
### Passive Low Pass Filter Calculator
This allows the user to enter 2 of the 3 values required, including their unti scales. This then calculates the result and displays it on the screen. As an example, if the user enters a Resistance value of 300 with a unit scale of mega-ohm, and a Cut-off Frequency of 50 with a unit scale of Hertz, the rult is provided as 10,61pF (pico-Farad) as the required Capacitance.

### Passive High Pass Filter Calculator
As with the Low Pass Filter, this allows the user to enter 2 of the 3 values required, including their unti scales. This then calculates the result and displays it on the screen. As an example, if the user enters a Resistance value of 8 with a unit scale of ohm, and a Cut-off Frequency of 8 with a unit scale of kHz, the rult is provided as 2.49Î¼F (micro-Farad) as the required Capacitance.

# Features to Implement in future
The following features can be added in the future, to help generate additional traffic and increase the opportunities for AdSense revenue
* Make the filter calculators available on the domains: lowpassfiltercalculator.com and highpassfiltercalculator.com
* Add AdSense configuration to the existing sites
* Build additional electrical / circuit based calculators

# Testing 
## Testing against client stories from UX section of README.md
- If the user lands on the home page, there is clear and direct links to the respective High Pass or Low Pass calculators, with a brief description of what to expect.
![Home Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pieterkdevilliers/audio-filters/main/docs/images/readme-images/home-page.webp)

- The **High Pass Filter Page** allows the user to calculate any of the required 3 values for creating a Passive High Pass Filter.

- The **Low Pass Filter Page** allows the user to calculate any of the required 3 values for creating a Passive Low Pass Filter. 
![Low Pass Filter Page](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pieterkdevilliers/audio-filters/main/docs/images/readme-images/lpf-page.webp)

    
## Code validation 
I used [W3C CSS validation](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri) and [W3C Markup Validation](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) and [JSLint](https://www.jslint.com/) to check the validity of the website code.

Several issues were identified on **W3C Markup Validation**.

After I rectified the issue, no further errors were picked up.

## Color Contrast 
The initial `color: ##81b214;` had Contrast Ratio of 2.52:1 with the white background. So I changed it to a darker green. The [Color Contrast Accessibility Validator](https://webaim.org/) was used to test for colour contrast on the project.

## COMPATIBILITY
To ensure a broad range of users can successfully view/use the site, I tested it across all major browsers in both desktop and mobile configuration.

* Chrome
* Edge
* Firefox
* Safari
* Internet Explorer

## Issues
The link on **Internet Explorer** does not recognise `font-antonio`. It displays the web using `San-sarif`. 

# Further testing
I asked my friends and family to click on the deployed link on their devices especially iPads and 17" and bigger laptops which I do not personally own. I added further bootstrap padding and margin and CSS media queries to make the website responsive on all devices.
